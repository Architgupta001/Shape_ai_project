# Shape_ai_project

It is a small project i did in my 7 days bootcamp by shape ai. 
In this we use the weather api from "api.openweathermap.org" and retrieve the information about weather conditions of a city, we want by entering any city name.
The extra feature i have made in this api is after retrieving the information it gives it in two formats JSON as well as TEXT.
Below You can see that how the information look like in both the formats.
